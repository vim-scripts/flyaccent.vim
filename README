Flying accent support for vim. When enabled (using :M command) you may type
a' (an 'a' letter and an apostrophe) to have an 'รก' character on screen. It's a bit like dead characters, but you type the accent after the letter, which is much more intuitive in my opinion.
 
Disabled by default, may be turned on/off using the :M command. Currently only Hungarian characters are present, but it's easy to add new ones.
